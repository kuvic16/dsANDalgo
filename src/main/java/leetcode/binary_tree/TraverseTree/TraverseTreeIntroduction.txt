A traverse a Tree - Introduction

1. Pre-order traversal
2. In-order traversal
3. Post-oder traversal
4. Recursive or Iterative

1. Pre-order traversal
is to visit the root first then traverse the left subtree and finally traverse the right subtree.
root->left->right

2. In-order traversal
is to traverse the left subtree first then visit the root and finally traverse the right subtree.
left->root->right

3. Post-order traversal
is to traverse the left subtree first then visit the right subtree and finally visit the root
left->right->root

NOTE:
------
1. Deleting nodes in a tree, deletion process will be in post-order.
2. Post-order is widely use in mathematical expression.
